# DBMS
Database Management System

This code is more of a proof of concept on how to use Flask to execute SQL procedures. After the server and database are online with the server's ports forwarded from the router, the end points defined in Flask can be tested via postman from any other machine provided they know the public IP of the machine that hosts the server.
